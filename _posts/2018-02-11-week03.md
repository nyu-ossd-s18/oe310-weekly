#  Wikipedia Contribution

## My first Wikipedia contribution

I contributed to the Wikipedia page on [black-and-white-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white_dualism). Details of the edit can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black-and-white_dualism&action=history). Note: my edit is tied to the IP address 67.80.163.249 but I also made minor edits under the username oeko96.

### How I picked the page

To help me find a page to edit, I started scrolling through Wikipedia pages that were tagged for cleanup and clicked on a few pages that piqued my interest. I took a look through the page on black and white dualism. While it is a cliche, I do sometimes enjoy talking about and reading about themes in literature and popular culture. 
### What I did
The layout of the page needed some work, and I also noted minor edits. With my first edit, I made the categories headings to make it easier to distinguish them. Then, I shifted around some examples to the appropriate category. I also made a small change of phrasing to improve the flow of one sentence and added an internal link.
