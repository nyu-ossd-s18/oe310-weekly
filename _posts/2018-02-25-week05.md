#Week 5

## This week's questions

1. When looking for an open source project to work on, I look at a number of different factors. One of the first things I try to gauge is whether the project matches well with what I know. I also look for instructions about how to contribute and try to gauge if the project welcomes new contributors. Activity in the issue tracker as well as with code commits is something else that I also look for in considering an open source project.
2. I could bring my experience working in web development to the project and perhaps contribute by helping edit the project's site and fix issues there. I could also help edit project documentation or hunt for bugs in addition to fixing minor bugs.
3. I hope to learn more about the longer term maintenance of a software project from working on open source, as well as gain experience working on a larger project. Most of my projects have been small in scope, and I have more experience in coding from scratch than in project software maintenance. 
4.  I'm most worried about the reception of my potential contributions and how I can gain better understanding of a project and help out in the best way.
