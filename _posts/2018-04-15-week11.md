# Week 11

## Team Progress 

For our team issue, we are working on adding snow to the game. This week we clarified what they meant by a snow slab and, after assigning sections, started work on creating the textures. I have been taking a look through the code base and will soon begin working on my part, which is adding code that allows snow slabs to pile up and eventually become a full snow block.

## Contributions this week

I made a minor edit on the Wikipedia page on black and white dualism after noticing there were extra bullet points in a couple of sections.
I also triaged two Terasology bugs, asking for more information as needed.
