# Week 9

## Group Project Progress

During this week's meeting, my group worked on going through the code base and finding bugs to potentially work on. Personally, I spent some time this week going through closed issues and pull requests to get a better sense of the life cycle of bugs. I also managed to triage a few bugs. However, in the coming week I want to spend some more time going through the code base which will help me understand the bugs and find an issue to work on with the team. I have less experience with Javascript compared with my group members, but I am trying to learn more and catch up.

## Questions for Danna
1. What have been some of your favorite projects to work on?
2. What misconceptions have you encountered about open source software at a company like Google?
3. Do you think open source development will grow even within larger traditional tech companies?

## Contributions

This week I validated a pull request for an issue I had previously opened on the course site. I also triaged 3 PDF.js bugs. Links to the contributions are on the contributions page and are labelled week 9.
