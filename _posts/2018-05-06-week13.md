# Final Course Thoughts

## What I learned

This course taught me what open source is and isn't. I also gained experience working on a large project and learned more about project maintenance. I wish that I had learned JavaScript and/or game development before taking the course, as JavaScript was a prominent language among the projects I had looked at. Game development would've been more helpful with my team project. I also wish there had been some clear recommendations with where to find easy projects.

## What I Would Change
What I would add to the course is a little more clarity with the contribution logistics (though granted teaching a class for the first time means trial and error). Perhaps in the future there should be a document on the site that lists all requirements for personal and group contributions. I think there also could be a section about open data, especially prior to open data week.
