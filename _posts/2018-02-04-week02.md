## The Cathedral and The Bazaar

In the cathedral model, the software is kept hidden until it's complete. On completion, it's unveiled as a grand project. Meanwhile, the bazaar model is more open. The software's source code is out and visible even before the project is complete. Users can see the work in progress and also acquire the right to use, modify, and make something new from it. I'm more familiar with the cathedral model, keeping my work behind the scenes until it's in a state I consider presentable. In my projects, I tend to test until I'm sure that it works how I want it to before even thinking of presenting it. But the bazaar model does have its benefits in allowing projects to grow and create a bigger impact.
